## MonkeyTrain

a Cognitive Chimp Test game that trains short-term memory.

---

**About**

MonkeyTrain is a short memory game built in Python using Pygame. The game demonstrates a grid of numbered tiles for a given amount of time. The numbers then disappear after clicking the first number, and the player must click the tiles in the correct order. When the order is completed correctly, the number of tiles will increase by one and will be randomised into different parts of the grid. If the order is incorrect, then the grid will reset to the original value. The main concept is to strengthen short-term memory through repeated practice.
The goal is to help users improve short-term number recall through fast pattern recognition. The target audience for a variety of people, including middle-school and high school students, adults, and older people.
