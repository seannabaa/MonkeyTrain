## **About**

MonkeyTrain is a short memory game built in Python using Pygame. The game demonstrates a grid of numbered tiles for a given amount of time. The numbers then disappear after clicking the first number, and the player must click the tiles in the correct order. When the order is completed correctly, the number of tiles will increase by one and will be randomised into different parts of the grid. If the order is incorrect, then the grid will reset to the original value. The main concept is to strengthen short-term memory through repeated practice.
The goal is to help users improve short-term number recall through fast pattern recognition. The target audience for a variety of people, including middle-school and high school students, adults, and older people.

## **Version History**

### *0.5 - Prototype (11/19)* 
- A rough outline of MonkeyTrain
- Includes a start game screen, 3x3 grid generation, and difficulty logic
- Rough Work of Visuals done, got a main idea down of the function and logic
- Click Detection is still bugged, and time is very short

### *1.0 - Beta Version Update (12/12)*
- Updated the User Interface to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
- created a "Controls and Help" feature that demonstrates the game's mechanics, controls, and difficulty progression.
- Controls & Help will also have Pro Tips and advice.
- Added 'Dark Mode' Feature that allows users to switch from normal UI colours to darker UI colours,
- Longer and adjusted time periods make it easier for the beginner stages to remember the n x m grid given.
- Overall revamped from the Prototype.

Your Criticism is needed! Please help me with this project. I hope to learn more every day while I build this cool project.
